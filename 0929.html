            gathered courage, stepping higher and higher, never giving up on its dream.

            In a village by the river, a little girl found a golden feather. She wondered if it belonged to a magical
            bird. Each night, she held it close, waiting for the bird to return for it.

            Far across the sea, a young fox built a boat of leaves and flowers. With stars guiding its way, it sailed
            bravely through the night, hoping to find friends on distant, unknown shores.
